# DataStructures and Algorithms
Backbone of each and every program and each software are Data Structures and Algorithms. Algorithms always transform the data to different
ways of solving. Understanding the data is more crucial and structuring it is an art, then algorithms can maintain and perform actions on 
those datas.
It is always challenging to structure the data, and what kind of algorithms to use to perform actions on datas. 
Each and every steps of data formulation is having a great significance.

##### While writing code, it's developers vision and thought to make it safe, secured, maintainable, portable, testable and reliable.

Industry compliance Coding Rules and Coding Standards are to be referred for making engineering practice better. Enforce coding rules with
static code analysis.

For Python - [pylint](https://github.com/pycqa/pylint) is good for code analysis and [AutoPep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) automatically fixes pep8.

As usual I always vote for [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)

This is the result of my love on learning and be on Data Structures and Algorithms, some of these codes are available on net.
